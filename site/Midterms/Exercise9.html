                <text id="DescTwo">Persona 4 blends traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game#:~:text=A%20role%2Dplaying%20game%20(sometimes,characters%20in%20a%20fictional%20setting." target="_blank">RPG</a> gameplay with simulation elements. <br>
                    The player controls the game's protagonist, a teenage boy who is named by the player, <br>
                    who comes to the town of Inaba for a year. Gameplay is divided between the real world of Inaba, <br>
                    where the protagonist carries out his daily life, and the mysterious "TV World", <br>
                    where various dungeons filled with monsters known as Shadows await. With the exception of scripted events, <br>
                    such as plot progression or special events, players can choose to spend their day how they like, <br>
                    be it participating in various real world activities, such as joining school clubs, <br>
                    taking part-time jobs, or reading books, or exploring the TV World's dungeons to gain experience and items<br>

            <text id ="def">Why is Persona 4 a must play for anyone who loves a good story?</text><br>
            <text id="DescTwo"> Persona 4's gameplay aside. The story has a good premise where a serial killer throwing people inside the TV<br>
            is on the loose and having you immersed in the game with investigations and making friends along the way can make the experince better<br>
            Good character writing is also one of persona 4's things that they are good at. Almost all the people here feel like humans <br>
            and not just scripted cardboard personalities.</text>
