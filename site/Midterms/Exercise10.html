                    <h3>GINTAMA</h3>
                    <h4>by: Hideaki Sorachi</h4>
                    <p><b>A Japanese manga series with a anime adaptation spanning over 300+ episodes
                        A samurai and his quirky band of friends take odd-jobs in an alternate 
                        version of feudal Japan that has been conquered by aliens. Gintama does a bit of everything that
                        is why I like the show. Comedy, Action, Drama and romance all of this genres the show does well.
                        Highly Recommend watching though it may have a slow start.</b>

                    <h3>The Quintessential Quintuplets</h3>
                    <h4>by: Negi Haruba.</h4>
                    <p><b>The series follows the daily life of a high school student Futaro Uesugi who is hired as a private tutor for a group of quintuplets, Ichika, Nino, Miku, Yotsuba and Itsuki Nakano, who perform poorly academically. At the very beginning of the story, it is indicated Futaro will marry one of the 
                        Nakano quintuplets but the identity of the bride is unknown until near the end of the story. The Manga has 14 Volumes and 122 Chapters.</b>

                    <h3>Pokemon Black and White</h3>
                    <h4>Developers: Game Freak, Creatures</h4>
                    <p><b>A Nintendo DS games that are the first core series Pok√©mon games of Generation V. The games were released in Japan on September 18, 2010.
                        One of my favorite Pokemon Games because it has the best story telling out of all the games even beating the new titles.
                        As usual you start as a young kid embarking on a journey with your childhood friends and as you climb your way through the elite four you meet N the leader of
                        a Infamous group in the region where they plan to liberate pokemon from the pokeballs that they are confined in. It tells a gripping story full of dillemas which is odd for a kids game which is why I love it.
